# 🌅 SnapRise — Scan. Snap. Start Your Day.

> Built for the **Trae AI IDE: Zero Limits Hackathon** ⚡

SnapRise is a cross-platform smart alarm app that *forces you out of bed* — literally. Instead of just tapping “Snooze,” you’ll have to scan a barcode in your kitchen or solve a brain-teasing riddle to dismiss your alarm.

---

## 🔥 Why SnapRise?

Ever canceled an alarm or ignored a call while half-asleep? SnapRise eliminates that by:
- Locking the alarm screen until you're truly awake
- Making you **move** (scan a real object)
- Or **think** (solve a quick riddle)

It’s accountability in your pocket.

- **React Native + Expo**
- `expo-notifications` for alarms
- `expo-camera` + `expo-barcode-scanner` for scan challenge
